# Crafty Coffee Templates

This is the Crafty Coffee template component documentation. The goal of this document is to demonstrate how to use the code here to build a website using these components.

## Template Structure

The code in this project is displayed in three different components:

1. **Templates** - the fully built templates as they are needed to build out the Crafty Coffee website in Craft CMS using the [Up and Running with Craft video course from CraftQuest](https://craftquest.io/courses/craft-cms-3-tutorials).
2. **Modules** - the larger pieces of templates that are assembled (with additional template-specific markup) to create the Templates. These are usable UI components. 
3. **Elements** - the smallest pieces of markup--typically actual HTML elements or slight enhancements of HTML elements. They represent the smallest, most atomic template artifacts.

## Technical Details

These templates use the following:

* Fractal (the tools that generates this documentation) 
* Twig
* Tailwind CSS
